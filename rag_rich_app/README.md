# RAG Streamlit UI – Multi‑PDF Upload & Query

This repo provides a Streamlit application to:

- Upload multiple PDFs into a Vertex AI RAG Engine corpus
- Rename files based on their content
- View basic statistics about the RAG corpus
- Ask deep, complex queries using an ADK RAG agent
- See backend activity and a description of the architecture/models in use

It is designed to plug into the Google ADK RAG sample (`adk-samples/python/agents/RAG`).
